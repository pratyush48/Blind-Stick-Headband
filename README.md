# Blind-Stick-Headband
This project was done as a part of basic electronics course final project.
The code repository of the project is as follows-
    In the folder named "Project_Code" there are two sub-folders:
        1. The folder "Blind_Stick_Arduino_Code" contains code in ".ino" format.
        2. The folder "Raspberry_pi" contains code for facial reognition, traffic light detection and     car recognition.
    The arduino code contains code for inter-linking multiple sensors present on blind stick.
    The facial recognition code contains code to first collect features set of the person to be recognized then a code to  collect approx. 30 pictures of the person then a code to recognize the person whose data set was collected.
    The blind stick is semi-interactive as the pi can communicate with the stick about it's location or asking if emergency services should be contacted when the person falls etc.
This project also got accepted for a conference held in prestigious Yogi Vemana University.
