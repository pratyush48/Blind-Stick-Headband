# Blind-Stick-Headband
This project was done as a part of basic electronics course final project.<br/>
The code repository of the project is as follows-<br />
    In the folder named "Project_Code" there are two sub-folders:<br />
        1. The folder "Blind_Stick_Arduino_Code" contains code in ".ino" format.<br />
        2. The folder "Raspberry_pi" contains code for facial reognition, traffic light detection and car recognition.<br/>
    The arduino code contains code for inter-linking multiple sensors present on blind stick.<br/>
    The facial recognition code contains code to first collect features set of the person to be recognized then a code to  collect approx. 30 pictures of the person then a code to recognize the person whose data set was collected.<br/>
    The blind stick is semi-interactive as the pi can communicate with the stick about it's location or asking if emergency services should be contacted when the person falls etc.<br/>
This project also got accepted for a conference held in prestigious Yogi Vemana University.<br/>
